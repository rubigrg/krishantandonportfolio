                It’s time to introduce myself.<br><br>
                *I began my career with All India Radio, Delhi as a drama artist in 1972, then continued to become an announcer with Vividh Bharti and Delhi stations.<br><br>

                *In late 70s participated in amateur theatre with LTG, Sapru House (very popular theatre hub in Mandi House). It became my passion and I joined main stream theatre in Hindi.<br><br>

                *I was also an announcer for the Trade Fair Authority of India, (Pragati Maidan) Satellite TV, (Mandi House). During this time I acted in first TV drama ‘Hum Log’ which would come on Doordarshan every day.<br><br>

                *In 1984, I acted in my first feature film ‘Gori’ alongside veteran actors Anupam Kher, Sadashiv Amrapurkar, Alok Nath and Bindu. The film was directed by Sudhakar Sharma (nowadays known as a lyric writer). I also did a few serials for Doordarshan, amongst CHUNNI became popular.<br><br>

                *I moved to London in 1994 and joined BBC Hindi Service as a broadcaster/journalist and worked there till 2008. In 2001 I started my own theatre company and conducted plays in Hindi, English, Punjabi and Gujarati. Have produced, wrote and directed plays under my company banner ‘Sakshi Arts.’<br><br>

                *I am an established voiceover artist and translator in the U.K.<br><br>

                *In 2014, I was chosen by Mukesh Chhabra to play a lawyer in SHANDAAR, in London. To shoot the film I travelled to Poland and India. In 2015 I acted in AZHAR (Balaji Films) followed by EKH ASEENA THI EK DEEWANA THA, DIL JUNGLEE, MUBARKAN, GOLD and Anil Sharma’s GENIUS (which was shot in India and Mauritius)<br><br>

                *More recently I have played Taapsee’s father in Dil Juunglee, released on the 9th March 2018.<br><br>

                *Whilst there I also shot for a internet web series.<br><br>

                *I believe that alongside strong work ethics, compassion and having a sense of humour are the key in success in any given path.<br>
